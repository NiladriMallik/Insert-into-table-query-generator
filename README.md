These python codes are for generating "INSERT INTO TABLE tableName VALUES" SQL statements by reading data from a .csv file. These python codes use the os and pandas libraries.

[InsertIntoTableScriptGenerator.py](https://github.com/NiladriMallik/Insert-into-table-query-generator/blob/main/InsertIntoTableScriptGenerator.py) generates SQL query of only one file, the first file with the input file extension.

[InsertIntoTableScriptGenerator_2_0.py](https://github.com/NiladriMallik/Insert-into-table-query-generator/blob/main/InsertIntoTableScriptGenerator_2_0.py) generates SQL queries of all the different files with the input file extension. A different SQL file is generated for each file.

The code is for tables with a particular set of columns and datatypes. Kindly modify the code according to your table and column datatype requirements.
